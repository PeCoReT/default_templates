#### Broken Access Control

Broken access control is a common flaw in web applications.


##### Overview
- Is it possible to access sensitive resources even if the user is not authenticated?
- Is it possible to access functions that should be accessible to a user that holds a different role or privilege?


You can use BurpSuite plugins like AuthMatrix/AuthAnalyzer to check for broken access control.
