The application uses a static initialization vector (IV) for encryption using CBC mode.

The IV is used to introduce randomness into the encryption process, ensuring that the same plaintext input does not always produce the same ciphertext output.
However, when a static IV is used, it is always the same and is never changed, meaning that an attacker can easily recognize patterns in the encrypted data, making it easier to crack the encryption.
