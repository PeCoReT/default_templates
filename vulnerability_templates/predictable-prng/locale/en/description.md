A predictable pseudo random number generator vulnerability is a weakness in a software system that uses a pseudo random number generator (PRNG) that can be exploited to predict the output sequence of the generator. A PRNG is an algorithm that generates a sequence of numbers that appears to be random, but is actually deterministic and therefore predictable.

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to guess future output sequences of the PRNG, and use this information to gain unauthorized access to the system or data. If the PRNG is used for cryptographic purposes, such as generating encryption keys or passwords, a predictable output sequence can be disastrous, as it allows an attacker to easily guess the keys or passwords.

This vulnerability can occur when the PRNG algorithm is not sufficiently complex, or when the input to the generator is not truly random. Additionally, predictable output sequences can occur due to seeds that are not sufficiently random or are easily guessable.
