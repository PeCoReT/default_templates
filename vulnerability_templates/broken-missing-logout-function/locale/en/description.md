The vulnerability "No Logout Function" refers to the absence of a mechanism to log out or terminate a user session on a website or application. This allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the user's account or data by using the active session of the user. Since there is no way to end the user's session, the attacker can impersonate the user and perform malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, making unauthorized transactions, or modifying account settings. This vulnerability is particularly critical in shared devices or public computers where multiple users might access the same system without proper logging out. It could also occur when the application does not provide an explicit button for logging out, or the log-out functionality does not work correctly.
