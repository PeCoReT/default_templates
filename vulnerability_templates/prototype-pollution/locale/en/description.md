The problem lies with the manner in which JavaScript implements inheritance by using a prototype.
What this means, in a nutshell, is that every object contains a reference to the prototype of its class. When a property is requested from a particular object, the runtime first checks if the instance has the aforementioned property; otherwise, it looks it up in the prototype chain, recursively.

The reference to the prototype is available via the `__proto__` property. The fact that the prototype itself is just an object that has properties makes the whole structure susceptible to unwanted alteration when properties have been assigned from any untrusted input.
