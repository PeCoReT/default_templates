Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
This can result in a range of harms from stealing sensitive information to taking over user accounts.

There are two types of XSS vulnerabilities: stored and reflected.

Stored XSS occurs when an attacker inserts a malicious script into a website that is then stored in a database or server.
This script is then served to every user that visits the website, causing harm to anyone who comes into contact with it.
The effects of stored XSS can be long-lasting and impactful as the script will continue to be served until it is detected and removed.

Reflected XSS, on the other hand, occurs when a user inputs a specific code into a website or server, and that code is then reflected back to them in the application's output page.
This code is then able to execute on the user's computer, causing harm to them. 
Reflected XSS is generally less harmful than stored XSS as the script muss be delivered to the victim.
