The *Open Redirect* vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect users from legitimate websites to malicious ones.
This vulnerability is caused when a web application allows a user to specify a URL to redirect to, which can be leveraged by an attacker to manipulate the URL with a malicious link. The user is then redirected to the attacker's website, which could contain malware, phishing scams, or other malicious content.
