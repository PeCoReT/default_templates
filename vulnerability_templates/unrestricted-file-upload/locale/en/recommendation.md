To prevent arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities, web applications should employ strict validation checks on uploaded files, such as verifying file extensions, content types, and employing server-side checks.
Additionally, implementing proper access controls, limiting file upload permissions, and scanning files for malware can help mitigate the risk of this vulnerability.
