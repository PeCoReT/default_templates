The application allows to upload arbitrary files onto the system.
This vulnerability typically occurs in web applications that accept user file uploads without proper validation or security checks. 
When exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can upload various types of malicious files, such as scripting files (e.g., PHP, Perl), executable files, or malware-infected files.
Once uploaded, these files can be executed, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, remote code execution, or system compromise.
