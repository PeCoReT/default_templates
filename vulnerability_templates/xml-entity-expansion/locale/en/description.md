The XML entity expansion vulnerability is a type of security vulnerability that occurs due to a flaw in the way XML (Extensible Markup Language) processors handle external entities in XML documents.

In such attacks, attackers insert malicious content into XML documents used by the target application. When the application processes these documents, it follows the instructions in the malicious content, which may allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, execute commands on the server, or cause a denial of service (DoS) attack.

The entity expansion vulnerability occurs when an XML parser expands entities in XML documents beyond the limits of the system, or when an untrusted XML document includes an external entity reference to a system or network resource. This allows attackers to inject malicious code or data into the system, leading to a potential security breach.
