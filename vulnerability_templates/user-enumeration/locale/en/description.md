User enumeration is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to gain access to sensitive information about users of a system, such as usernames or email addresses, by exploiting weaknesses in its authentication mechanisms.
This vulnerability enables attackers to determine valid usernames or email addresses using valid and invalid credentials and then observing the error message that the system returns.
The error message may reveal whether the attempted username or email address is valid or invalid, thereby providing an attacker with valuable information that can be used to launch targeted attacks, such as brute force attacks or phishing attacks.
User enumeration attacks can be particularly dangerous in environments where users have weak passwords or reuse the same password across multiple systems, as this makes it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or systems.
