To prevent user enumeration, organizations can implement a number of best practices including:

- Implement two-factor authentication to reduce the effectiveness of credential stuffing attacks.
- Use non-specific error messages when validating user credentials to obscure the difference between valid and invalid usernames.
- Limit login attempts and add CAPTCHAs to prevent automated attacks.
- Provide educational resources to users on the importance of using strong, unique passwords to minimize the likelihood of successful credential stuffing.
- Monitor for unusual activity, such as a large number of rapid login attempts, and use effective incident response protocols to mitigate risk.

By following these recommendations, organizations can decrease the likelihood of an attacker successfully exploiting user enumeration vulnerabilities.
